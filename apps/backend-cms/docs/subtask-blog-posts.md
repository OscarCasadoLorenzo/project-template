# [Subtask] Implement Blog Posts Entity in PayloadCMS

## Overview

This issue covers the implementation of the Blog Posts entity for the PayloadCMS backend powering a personal portfolio project. It includes the collection schema, endpoints, DTOs, and supporting functions, following best practices for integration with a Next.js frontend.

## Entity: BlogPost

### Required Attributes & Types

- **id**: string (auto-generated by PayloadCMS)
- **title**: string (required)
- **slug**: string (required, customizable by user, must be unique)
- **content**: rich text (Markdown or WYSIWYG, required)
- **excerpt**: string (short summary, optional)
- **coverImage**: media reference (optional)
- **tags**: array of strings (optional, for categorization)
- **publishedAt**: datetime (required, for scheduling and sorting)
- **author**: reference to User (required)
- **status**: enum ["draft", "published", "archived"] (required)
- **createdAt**: datetime (auto-generated)
- **updatedAt**: datetime (auto-generated)

### Validation & Best Practices

- Slug must be customizable by the user and checked for uniqueness before creation or update
- Enforce unique slugs for SEO-friendly URLs
- Validate required fields and types on create/update
- Support rich content editing (e.g., images, code blocks)
- Allow filtering and sorting by publishedAt, status, and tags

## Endpoints

- **GET /api/blog-posts**: List all blog posts (with filtering, sorting, and pagination)
- **GET /api/blog-posts/:slug**: Get a single blog post by slug
- **POST /api/blog-posts**: Create a new blog post (admin/editor only)
- **PUT /api/blog-posts/:id**: Update an existing blog post (admin/editor only)
- **DELETE /api/blog-posts/:id**: Delete a blog post (admin/editor only)

All endpoints should:

- Return data optimized for Next.js data fetching (e.g., minimal nesting, ISO date strings)
- Enforce authentication and role-based access control for mutations
- Validate input using DTOs

## DTOs & Functions

- **CreateBlogPostDto**: Validates required fields for creation
- **UpdateBlogPostDto**: Validates updatable fields
- **BlogPostResponseDto**: Shapes API responses for frontend consumption
- **Utility Functions**:
  - Slug uniqueness validation
  - Excerpt generation from content
  - Tag normalization

## Workflows

- **Admin/Editor**: Create, edit, publish, or archive blog posts via secure dashboard
- **Public**: Fetch published blog posts for display in the portfolio frontend
- **Preview**: Support draft preview for authenticated users

## Acceptance Criteria

- BlogPost collection schema is defined and registered in PayloadCMS
- All endpoints are implemented and documented
- DTOs and utility functions are in place and tested
- Access control and validation are enforced
- API responses are compatible with Next.js frontend requirements
